## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Toggle the mobile menu (requires some JavaScript)

## My process
Was fairly simple. I had to think a bit about matching the image's height to the 
content in the bottom third, Ended up using JavaScript. 
The solution is suboptimal, it results in smaller images here and there. The cause is 
still unknown.
I wish I could use subgrid :(

### Built with
